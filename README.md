# Project.9_MatrixMultiplication
Creating a class that stores and manipulates matrices as well as developing operator overloads.

## **Project Overview**  
This project implements matrix multiplication using multi-dimensional arrays in C++. It focuses on creating a `Matrix_Class` that can store and manipulate matrices, while also introducing operator overloading and C++11 features.

## **Objectives**  
- Implement matrix multiplication with multi-dimensional arrays.  
- Develop and use a `Matrix_Class` to handle matrix operations.  
- Overload operators for matrix manipulation.  
- Use C++11 features.  
- Maintain good coding practices with readable, well-documented code.

## **Program Features**  
- Input matrices from the user and print them.  
- Perform matrix multiplication with operator overloading.  
- Resize matrices dynamically.  
- Handle incompatible matrix multiplication with appropriate error handling.
